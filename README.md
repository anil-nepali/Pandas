# 🐼 Pandas Essentials

Welcome to my Pandas learning repository! This repo contains my practice files, exercises, and notes while learning **Pandas** — a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

## 📌 What is Pandas?

Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library) is an open-source library that makes it easy to work with structured data using:

- **DataFrames**: 2D labeled tabular data (like Excel)
- **Series**: 1D labeled arrays (like a column in Excel)

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Easy handling of missing data
- Powerful data filtering and selection
- Built-in functions for grouping, reshaping, merging, and pivoting
- Integration with NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn
- Reading/writing from multiple data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL)

## 📚 Resources I Used
